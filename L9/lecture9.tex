 \section{Introduction}
 
  \begin{frame}{Single-agent vs Muli-agent Learning}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0.7em}
    \item In artificial intelligence (AI), learning is usually performed by \alert{single agent}
    \item Learning agent learns to function successfully in \alert{unknown environment}
    \item In multi-agent setting, environment contains other agents
    \item Agents' learning changes the environment
    \item These changes \alert{depend} in part on actions of learning agents
    \item Learning of each agent is \alert{impacted} by learning performed by others
    \item Different learning rules lead to different \alert{dynamical system}
    \item Simple learning rules can lead to complex global behaviors of system
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Learning and Teaching}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0.5em}
    \item In multi-agent systems, learning and teaching are inseparable
    \item Agents must consider what they have \alert{learned} from others' past behavior
    \item They also must consider how they wish to \alert{influence} others' future behavior
    \item In such setting, learning as \alert{accumulating knowledge} is not always beneficial
    \item Accumulating knowledge should never hurt, one can always ignore what is learned
    \item But when one pre-commits to particular strategy for \\acting on accumulated knowledge, sometimes less is more
    \item E.g., in game of Chicken, if your opponent is learning your strategy to play best response, then optimal strategy is to always dare
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Is Agent Learning in Optimal Way?}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]\small
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0.7em}
    \item In (repeated or stochastic) zero-sum games, this question is meaningful to ask
    \item In general, answer depends not only on learning procedure but also on others' behavior
    \item When all agents adopt same strategy, the setting is called \alert{self-play}
    \begin{itemizes}[0.5em]
     \item  E.g., all agent adopt TfT, or all adopt reinforcement learning (RL)
    \end{itemizes}
    \item One way to evaluate learning procedures is based on their performance in self-play
    \item But learning agents can also be judged by how they do in context of other agent types
    \begin{itemizes}[0.5em]
     \item TfT agent may perform well against TfT agents, but less well against RL agents
    \end{itemizes}
    \item Note that in GT, \alert{optimal strategy} is replaced by \alert{best response} (and equilibrium)
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Properties of Learning Rules}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{1.5em}
    \item \alert{Safety}: Guarantee agents at least their maxmin value
    \item \alert{Rationality}: Settle on best response to opponent's strategy whenever opponent settles on stationary strategy
    \begin{itemizes}
     \item Opponent adopts same mixed strategy each time, regardless of the past
    \end{itemizes}
    \item \alert{No regret}: Yield payoff that is no less than payoff agent could have obtained by playing any pure strategy against any set of opponents (details later!)
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  

 \section{Background}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Nash Equilibrium}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0.7em}
    \item \alert{Nash equilibrium (NE)}: No agent wins from unilateral deviation
    $$u_i(s_i^*,s_{-i}^*) \ge u_i(s_i^\prime,s_{-i}^*) ~~~~ \forall i, s_i^\prime$$
    \item \alert{Pure-strategy NE}: NE strategies are pure strategies for all agents
    \begin{itemizes}[0.5em]
     \item It is opposite of \alert{mixed-strategy NE}
    \end{itemizes}
    \item \alert{Strict NE}: Any agent who unilaterally deviates looses
    $$u_i(s_i^*,s_{-i}^*) > u_i(s_i^\prime,s_{-i}^*) ~~~~ \forall i, s_i^\prime\ne s_i^*$$
    \vspace{-1em}
    \begin{itemizes}[0.5em]
     \item It is opposite of \alert{weak NE}
     \item Each agent has unique best response to others
     \item Strict NE is necessarily a pure-strategy NE (why?)
    \end{itemizes}
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Nash Equilibrium (cont.)}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0.7em}
    \item \alert{Strong NE}: No coalition of agents wins by unilateral deviation
    \begin{itemizes}[0.5em]
     \item It is not opposite of weak NE! NE can be both strong and weak, either, or neither!
     \item It implies \alert{Pareto-optimality}
    \end{itemizes}
    \item \alert{Stable NE}: No agent wins by small unilateral deviation, one who deviates loses
    \begin{itemizes}[0.5em]
     \item It is opposite of \alert{unstable NE}
     \item Agents who did not change have no better strategy in the new circumstance
     \item Agent who made a small unilateral change will return immediately to NE
    \end{itemizes}
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Nash Equilibrium Beyond Two-player Zero-sum Games}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{1.2em}
    \item NE is invaluable \alert{descriptive} tool in game theory
    \item But NE is problematic as \alert{prescriptive} tool beyond two-player zero-sum game
    \item NE is hard to compute even in two-player general-sum games
    \item Equilibrium selection is challenging (coordination without communication)
   \end{itemize}

   \begin{columns}
    \begin{column}{0.75\textwidth}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0.7em}
    \item CE is notion of rationality proposed by Aumann\footnotemark
    \item Agents receive \alert{recommendations} according to distribution
    \item Distribution is CE if agents have no incentives to deviate
    \item It overcomes shortcomings of NE as prescriptive tool
    \item CE does not suffer from equilibrium selection
    \item And, it enables better social welfare
    \item CE arises naturally as empirical frequency of play by independent learners (details later!)

    for all $i$ and $a_i^\prime$

  \begin{frame}{Coarse Correlated Equilibrium}

    \item Distribution $\pi$ over action profiles $A$ is coarse correlated equilibrium if:
    $$\E_{a \sim \pi}[u_i(a)] \geq \E_{a \sim \pi}[u_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i})]$$\\
    for all $i$ and $a_i^\prime$
    \item After $a$ is drawn, playing $a_i$ is best response for $i$ \alert{before} seeing $a_i$, given that everyone else plays according to $a$
    \item This makes sense if agents have to commit \alert{up front} to following recommendations or not (deviations are not allowed after recommendations are received)
    \item Coarse correlated equilibrium could occasionally recommend really bad actions!

 \section{Fictitious Play}
  
  \begin{frame}{Fictitious Play: Introduction}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{1.2em}
    \item What are agents learning about?
    \item Arguably, most plausible answer is strategies of others
    \item \alert{Fictitious} play (FP), one of earliest learning rules, takes this approach
    \item FB was first introduced by G. W. Brown in 1951%
    \footnote{Brown, George W. ``Iterative solution of games by fictitious play.''}
    \item Brown imagined that agents would \alert{``simulate''} the game in their mind and update their future play based on this simulation; hence name fictitious play
    \item In its current use, FP is misnomer, since each play of the game actually occurs
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Fictitious Play}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Two agents repeatedly play stage game $G$
    \item $\eta_i^t(a_{-i})$ denotes number of times agent $i$ has observed $a_{-i}$ before time $t$
    \item $\eta_i^1$ represents \alert{fictitious past} and cannot be zero for all $a_{-i}$
    \item Agents assume that their opponent is using \alert{stationary mixed strategy}
    \item Agents \alert{update their beliefs} about this strategy at each step according to:
    $$\mu_i^t(a_{-i})=\frac{\eta_i^t(a_{-i})}{\sum_{a_{-i}^\prime}\eta_i^t(a_{-i}^\prime)}$$
    \item $\mu_i^t$ is \alert{empirical distribution} of past actions and is treated as mixed strategy
    \item Agents best-respond to their beliefs about opponent' strategy
    $$a_i^{t+1}=\underset{a_i}{\argmax}~u_i(a_i,\mu_i^t)$$
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Fictitious Play: Example}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Consider the following coordination game
    \begin{center}\scriptsize
     \hspace{-3.5em}
     \begin{game}{2}{2}
      	\> L		\> R		\\
      U	\> $3,3$	\> $0,0$	\\
      D	\> $4,0$	\> $1,1$
     \end{game}
    \end{center}
    \vspace{1em}
    \item Note that this game is dominant solvable with unique NE of (D, R)
    \item Suppose that $\eta_1^1 = (3, 0)$ and $\eta_2^1 = (1, 2.5)$
    \item FP proceeds as follows:
    \vspace{1em}
    \begin{center}
     \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
      Round	& 1's $\eta$	& 2's $\eta$	& 1's action	& 2's action			\\ \hline
      1		& (3, 0)		& (1, 2.5) 	& D			& L			\pause	\\
      2		& (4, 0)		& (1, 3.5) 	& D			& R			\pause	\\
      3		& (4, 1)		& (1, 4.5) 	& D			& R			\pause	\\
      4		& (4, 2)		& (1, 5.5) 	& D			& R					\\
     \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Fictitious Play: Discussion}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{1.2em}
    \item In FP, agents \alert{do not} need to know anything about their opponent's utilities
    \item FP is somewhat paradoxical as agents assume stationary strategy for their opponent, yet no agent plays stationary strategy except when FP converges
    \item Even though FP is \alert{belief based} it is also \alert{myopic}
    \item I.e., agents maximize current utility without considering their future ones
    \item Agents do not learn \alert{true model} that generates empirical frequencies
    \item In other words, they do not learn how their opponent is actually playing the game
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Convergence of Fictitious Play to Pure Strategies}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{1.2em}
    \item Let $\{a^t\}$ be sequence of action profiles generated by FP for $G$
    \item Sequence \alert{converges} to $a^*$ if there exists $T$ s.t. $a^t = a^*$ for all $t\ge T$
    \item $a^*$ is called \alert{steady state} or \alert{absorbing state} of FP
    \item (I) If sequence converges to $a^*$, then $a^*$ is pure-strategy NE of $G$
    \item (II) If for some $t$, $a^t = a^*$, where $a^*$ is strict NE of $G$, then $a^\tau = a^*$ for all $\tau > t$
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Proof}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item (I) is straightforward, for (II), let $a^t = a^*$, we want to show that $a^{t+1} = a^*$
    \item First, note that we can write $\mu$ as: 
    $$\mu_i^{t+1} = (1-\alpha)\mu_i^t + \alpha a_{-i}^t = (1-\alpha)\mu_i^t + \alpha a^*_{-i}$$
    here, abusing notation, $a_{-i}^t$ denotes degenerate probability distribution and:
    $$\alpha = \frac{1}{\sum_{a_{-i}^\prime}\eta_i^t(a_{-i}^\prime)+1}$$
    \item By linearity of expected utility, we have for all $a_i$:
    $$u_i(a_i,\mu_i^{t+1} = (1-\alpha)u_i(a_i,\mu_i^t)+\alpha u_i(a_i,a_{-i}^*)$$
    \item Since $a_i^*$ maximizes both terms, it follows that it is played at $t+1$
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Convergence of Fictitious Play to Mixed Strategies}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0.7em}
    \item Of course, one cannot guarantee that fictitious play always converges to NE
    \item In FP, agents only play pure strategies and pure-strategy NE may not exist
    \item While FP sequence may not converge, its empirical distribution may
    \item Sequence $\{a^t\}$ converges to $s^*$ in time-average sense if for all $i$ and $a_i$:
    $$\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}\mathds{1}(a_i^t=a_i)}{T} = s^*_i(a_i)$$
    $\mathds{1}(\cdot)$ denotes the indicator function
    \item If FP sequence converges to $s^*$ in the time-average sense, then $s^*$ is NE
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Proof}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \setlength{\itemsep}{1.2em}
    \item Suppose $\{a^t\}$ converges to $s^*$ in time-average sense, but $s^*$ is not NE
    \item There is some $i$, $a_i^\prime$, and $a_i$ with $s_i^*(a_i)>0$ s.t. $u_i(a_i^\prime,s_{-i}^*)>u_i(a_i,s_{-i}^*)$
    \item Choose $\epsilon$ s.t. $\epsilon < \left(u_i(a_i^\prime,s_{-i}^*) - u_i(a_i,s_{-i}^*)\right)/2$
    \item Choose $T$ s.t. for all $t\ge T$, $\vert \mu_i^t(a_{-i}) - s_{-i}^*(a_{-i}) \vert < \epsilon/\max_{a^\prime} u_i(a^\prime)$ for all $a_{-i}$
    \item This is possible because $\mu_i^t(a_{-i})\to s_{-i}^*(a_{-i})$ by assumption
   \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
  
  
  \begin{frame}{Proof (cont.)}
   \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Then, for any $t \ge T$, we have:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
     u_i(a_i, \mu_i^t) & = & \sum_{a_{-i}}u_i(a_i, a_{-i})\mu_i^t(a_{-i}) \\ \pause
     & \le & \sum_{a_{-i}}u_i(a_i, a_{-i})s_{-i}^*(a_{-i}) + \epsilon \\ \pause
     & \le & \sum_{a_{-i}}u_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i})s_{-i}^*(a_{-i}) - \epsilon \\ \pause
     & \le & \sum_{a_{-i}}u_i(a_i^\prime, a_{-i})\mu_i^t(a_{-i}) = u_i(a_i^\prime, \mu_i^t) \\ \pause
    \end{eqnarray*}
    \vspace{-2em}
    \item<5-> So after sufficiently large $t$, $a_i$ is never played
    \item<6-> This implies that as $t \to \infty$, $\mu_i^t(a_i)\to 0$, which contradicts with $s_i^*(a_i) > 0$

    \item Fictitious play converges in time-average sense for game $G$ if:
    \begin{itemizes}
     \item $G$ is zero-sum game
     \item $G$ is two-player game where each agent has at most two actions (2x2 games)
     \item $G$ is solvable by iterated strict dominance

    \item Suppose that all agents use MW algorithm to choose between $k$ actions
    \item After $T$ steps, sequence of outcomes has external regret of $\Delta(T) = 2\sqrt{\log k/T}$
    \item Empirical distribution of outcomes forms $\Delta(T)$-approximate CCE

  \begin{frame}{Swap Regret}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]\small
    \item Sequence $a^1,\dots,a^T$ has \alert{swap regret} of $\Delta(T)$ if for every agent $i$ and every \alert{switching function} $F_i:A_i\rightarrow A_i$:
    $$\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T u_i(a^t) \geq \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T u_i(F_i(a_i),a_{-i}) - \Delta(T)$$
    \item If $\Delta(T) = o_T(1)$, we say that sequence of action profiles has no swap regret
    \item This measures regret to counterfactual case where every action of particular type is swapped with different action in hindsight, separately for each action
    \item E.g., ``Every time $i$ bought Microsoft, $i$ should have bought Apple, and every time $i$ bought Google, $i$ should have bought Comcast.''
    \item If $a^1,\dots,a^T$ has $\epsilon$ swap regret, then distribution $\pi$ that picks among $a^1,\dots,a^T$ uniformly at random is $\epsilon$-approximate correlated equilibrium

    \item $F_i$ is \alert{constant} switching function if $F_i(a_i) = F_i(a_i')$ for all $a_i,a_i' \in A_i$

  \begin{frame}{How to Achieve No Swap Regret}
   \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item Define set of time steps that expert $j$ is selected:
    $$S_j = \{t : a_t = j\}$$
    \item Observation: To achieve no swap regret it would be sufficient that for every $j$:
    $$\frac{1}{|S_j|}\sum_{t \in S_j}\ell^t_{a_t} \leq \frac{1}{|S_j|}\min_i \sum_{t\in S_j}\ell^t_i + \Delta(T)$$
    \item No \alert{swap} regret = no \alert{external} regret separately on each sequence of actions $S_j$
    \item Best switching function in hindsight = swapping each action $j$ for best fixed action in hindsight over $S_j$
    \item Idea: Run $k$ copies of PW, one responsible for each $S_j$
